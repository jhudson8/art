# Vision for a Bold Cryptocurrency Future

## Goals:

1. **Offer an Alternative to Bitcoin** – While Bitcoin was a groundbreaking innovation, it's first-generation tech. The goal is to provide a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and scalable alternative for everyday transactions.
2. **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** – The long-term objective is to distribute a basic living wage to anyone who opts in, paid in cryptocurrency.
3. **Show Extreme Generosity Can Coexist with Wealth** – By embracing a system of wealth creation and sharing, we can demonstrate that financial success and generosity can thrive together.

## Core Beliefs:

1. **Value from Belief** – Cryptocurrencies, having no intrinsic value, achieve high valuations purely based on the collective belief of the community. The chosen cryptocurrency’s value will rely entirely on the strength of this shared conviction.
2. **Valuation by Consensus** – If a critical mass of people agrees on the cryptocurrency's value based on reasonable conditions and calculations, that value can become real. Bitcoin’s success has demonstrated how collective belief can drive astronomical valuations, making future milestones plausible and achievable.
3. **Adoption through Incentives** – Providing free value to everyone will incentivize wallet creation and network activity, adding more utility to the cryptocurrency.
4. **A Novel Idea Can Attract Support** – If a cryptocurrency aligns wealth creation with environmental sustainability and altruistic outcomes, people will rally around it.
5. **Transparency Drives Trust** – The health of the movement will be publicly tracked, showing who is donating, how much is being donated, and who is registering to receive the stipend. This transparency will reinforce trust and participation.
6. **Grassroots Power** – We've seen movements like GameStop achieve success through passionate communities. This cryptocurrency movement can replicate that by building a strong, dedicated user base.

## How to Achieve This:

1. **Clear Milestones for Valuation** – A roadmap can outline the cryptocurrency’s value growth based on milestones reflecting increased utility and network participation. These milestones should be considered reasonable because Bitcoin’s current valuation shows that such market caps are not out of reach.
2. **Prevent Boom and Bust Cycles** – By paying a monthly stipend to everyone in the cryptocurrency, demand is sustained over time, preventing rapid growth and crash cycles.
3. **Leverage the Strengths of the Chosen Cryptocurrency** – The chosen cryptocurrency should be decentralized, have low transaction fees (or none), be environmentally friendly, and support a high number of transactions per second (TPS).
4. **Low Market Cap is Critical for Growth** – Achieving exponential growth through the proposed milestones requires starting with a cryptocurrency that has a low market cap, as this leaves room for multiple 10x increases in value while staying grounded in reality. For example, **Nano (XNO)**, with a market cap of around $120 million USD, offers the perfect base for 5 successive 10x milestones. **IOTA (MIOTA)**, while meeting many of the same requirements, has a market cap roughly 4x higher than Nano, giving it less room for exponential growth, but it’s still a viable option.
5. **Lead by Example** – As the author, I will donate 100% of my holdings in the selected cryptocurrency to kickstart this initiative.

## Milestones for the Future:

1. **10x Growth to $1.2B Market Cap** – The first major jump in value, driven by early adopters who believe in and spread the idea.
2. **10x Growth to $12B Market Cap (20x Overall)** – Supporters commit to donating 90% of their holdings, but only after the cryptocurrency’s valuation has increased by 20x, ensuring that their initial investment has at least doubled. Users register to become donators in a simple way, such as commenting on a public post on Twitter or Reddit. When registering to donate, users agree to hold onto their cryptocurrency for at least one year or until donations are collected. This milestone ends when a critical mass of users has registered in this informal manner.
3. **10x Growth to $120B Market Cap** – Establish a more formal organization to track donation pledges and manage UBI registrations. This organization will work to assist with wallets, prevent fraud, and handle user onboarding. **Donations are still not collected at this stage**, but the process of tracking donations and ensuring transparency begins in earnest. The milestone ends once formal registration has gained significant adoption.
4. **10x Growth to $1.2T Market Cap (equal to Bitcoin 2024)** – Form a grassroots organization to transparently manage and distribute donations, ensuring the foundation for paying out the cryptocurrency UBI is solid. **Donations will only be collected after this milestone**, as this ensures the infrastructure is in place to handle them. By this point, early adopters will have been greatly rewarded for their risk, and the incentive to donate will be much higher to sustain the movement.
5. **10x Growth to $12T Market Cap** – Once a critical mass of donations (e.g., 30% of the cryptocurrency’s market cap) is collected, the infrastructure to begin paying stipends is prepared.
6. **Stable Growth** – At this stage, the focus shifts from exponential growth to long-term sustainability. The cryptocurrency’s value growth will be aligned with global average inflation rates. This predictable growth rate helps a large group of people come to a shared understanding of the cryptocurrency’s value, ensuring stability and long-term viability. The monthly stipend will begin modestly, likely benefiting populations in developing countries first. Over time, the cryptocurrency’s value will grow steadily, contributing to global wealth redistribution to those that recognize the importance of generosity in a successful society.

## Conclusion:

This plan provides a step-by-step framework for transforming a cryptocurrency into a tool for financial inclusion, sustainability, and wealth redistribution. Valuation cannot be dictated but rather emerges organically from collective belief. By proposing a novel idea with a mechanism for reinforcing value through achieving challenging milestones and a calculatable future trajectory after initial growth, we aim to guide a critical mass of people towards a shared understanding of how to value the cryptocurrency in the future. As the cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value, this collective perspective will be crucial for its success, potentially allowing the envisioned outcome to come to fruition. Through grassroots support, clear milestones, and transparency in donations and stipends, we can create a more equitable financial system.

## Suggested Cryptocurrencies:

For this vision to succeed, the chosen cryptocurrency must be eco-friendly, decentralized, have a relatively low market cap (to allow for growth), high transaction throughput (TPS), and nearly instant transaction confirmations. Two cryptocurrencies that meet these criteria are **Nano (XNO)** and **IOTA (MIOTA)**:

- **Nano (XNO):** Nano offers instant, fee-less transactions, a low market cap, and a focus solely on payments. Its ethical distribution and environmentally friendly nature make it an ideal candidate for this movement.
- **IOTA (MIOTA):** IOTA is another option, though its market cap is about 4x that of Nano, offering slightly less growth potential. It also supports smart contracts, which adds complexity but still fits many of the necessary criteria for this initiative.
